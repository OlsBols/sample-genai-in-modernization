# MAP Agentic Accelerator

An AI-powered platform for AWS cloud migration — from initial assessment through business case generation and execution planning. Built with multi-agent orchestration on Amazon Bedrock.

## Components

This repository contains two independent but complementary toolsets:

| Component | Description | Docs |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| **MAP Migration Accelerator** | End-to-end migration lifecycle: portfolio discovery, dependency analysis, strategy, cost estimation, landing zone design, task breakdown, runbooks, and resource planning. Built with Strands Agents SDK and Claude Sonnet 4. | [map-migration-accelerator/README.md](map-migration-accelerator/README.md) |
| **Business Case Generator** | Multi-agent business case generation with real-time AWS pricing, Excel exports, EKS analysis, backup cost modelling, and 9 standalone GenAI use cases. | [agentic-ai-business-case/README.md](agentic-ai-business-case/README.md) |

## Use Cases at a Glance

### MAP Migration Accelerator

| # | Use Case | What It Does |
| - | -------- | ------------ |
| 1 | Portfolio Discovery & Dependency Analysis | Classifies applications, builds dependency graphs, scores migration complexity |
| 2 | Migration & Modernisation Strategy | Evaluates 5 wave planning strategies (WP1–WP5), R-type classification, Gantt charts |
| 3 | AWS Cost Estimation & MAP Milestone Prediction | Monthly/annual cost projections, $50K MAP milestone forecasting |
| 4 | Landing Zone Design | Architecture design, CloudFormation IaC templates, Draw.io diagrams |
| 5 | Task Breakdown & Taiga Integration | Waves → Epics → Stories → Tasks hierarchy, push to Taiga for Kanban tracking |
| 6 | Wave Runbook Generation | Pre-migration checklists, cutover steps, rollback plans, comms templates |
| 7 | Resource Planning | Hub-and-Spoke vs Wave-Based team models, role-based costing |
| 8 | What-If Scenario Chat | Multi-turn chat across any combination of generated outputs |
| 9 | Reports & Artifacts Download | One-click download of all outputs (JSON, MD, YAML, Draw.io XML) |
| 10 | Architecture Diagram Generation | Describe AWS architecture in natural language, generate professional Draw.io XML diagrams |

### Business Case Generator & GenAI Use Cases

| # | Use Case | What It Does |
| - | -------- | ------------ |
| 1 | Business Case Generation | 9-agent system generating 7-section business case with real-time AWS pricing and Excel exports |
| 2 | Learning Pathway | Personalised AWS training and certification roadmaps based on team profiles |
| 3 | Business Case Review | Validate existing business case PDFs against AWS best practices |
| 4 | Service Analysis | Identify missing AWS services and ARR opportunities from Calculator exports |
| 5 | OLA Analysis | Licensing optimisation (Windows, SQL Server, Oracle) with bin-packing and BYOL guidance |
| 6 | EKS Container Migration | Deterministic 4-tier recommendation engine for EC2 vs EKS decisions |
| 7 | AWS Backup Cost Analysis | Intelligent storage tiering with environment-aware retention (up to 85% savings) |
| 8 | Chat Assistant | Context-aware chat with access to all generated outputs |

## Quick Start
