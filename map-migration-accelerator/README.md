# MAP Agentic Accelerator

## Overview

An AI-powered AWS cloud migration assessment and execution planning platform built with [Strands Agents SDK](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python). It uses multi-agent orchestration patterns — parallel graphs, sequential graphs, and standalone agents — to guide users through the full migration lifecycle, from portfolio discovery through dependency analysis, strategy recommendation, AWS cost estimation, landing zone design, task breakdown, resource planning, and project management integration.

All agents use Claude Sonnet 4 via Amazon Bedrock with real-time streaming through Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Features

### 1. Portfolio Discovery & Dependency Analysis

- Parallel AI analysis of application and infrastructure CSV inventories
- Application classification (Legacy, Home Grown, SaaS, Third Party) with EOL risk identification
- Deterministic dependency graph construction with cluster detection, circular dependency identification, and migration complexity scoring
- AI-enriched executive summary with migration rationale

### 2. Migration & Modernisation Strategy

- Evaluates five wave planning strategies (WP1–WP5) with velocity pattern recommendation
- R-type classification (Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Retire, Retain, Repurchase)
- Gantt chart visualisation for wave timelines

### 3. AWS Cost Estimation & MAP Milestone Prediction

- Modernisation pathway analysis with AWS service recommendations
- Monthly and annual run-rate cost projections
- Cumulative spend forecasting with $50K MAP milestone prediction
- Acceleration recommendations for milestone achievement

### 4. Landing Zone Design

- Multi-agent graph producing architecture design, IaC templates (CloudFormation), and Draw.io diagrams
- Region, account strategy, and connectivity configuration inputs

### 5. Task Breakdown & Integration with Project Management Platform (Taiga Integration)

- Structured hierarchy: Waves → Epics → Stories → Tasks with Gantt chart
- Integrates with [Taiga](https://taiga.io/), an open-source agile project management platform, to push the generated task breakdown directly into a Taiga project
- Taiga agent authenticates via REST API, creates epics, user stories, and tasks, and links stories to epics automatically
- Enables Kanban board sync so migration teams can track execution progress directly in Taiga without manual data entry

### 6. Wave Runbook Generation

- Pre-migration checklist, cutover steps, rollback plan, and communication templates

### 7. Resource Planning

- Team structure evaluation (Hub-and-Spoke vs Wave-Based models)
- Wave-based resource allocation with role-based costing
- Customisable resource profile template

### 8. What-If Scenario Chat

- Context-aware multi-turn conversation across any combination of generated outputs
- Selective context chip toggles — choose which outputs to include as chat context
- Mermaid diagram and table rendering in responses

### 9. Reports & Artifacts Download

- Centralised download page for all generated outputs (JSON, Markdown, YAML, Draw.io XML)
- Session-based status tracking with one-click download

### 10. Architecture Diagram Generation

- Describe any AWS architecture in natural language and generate a professional Draw.io XML diagram
- AI produces properly styled diagrams with AWS service icons, connections, and layout
- Download the generated `.drawio` file or open it directly in draw.io for editing

## Important Notes

> 💡 **AI Accuracy Disclaimer:** Whilst GenAI provides valuable insights, it may occasionally produce non-deterministic outcomes due to its probabilistic nature. Always validate AI-generated recommendations before implementation.
>
> 💡 **Proof of Concept:** This solution is designed for proof-of-concept purposes to explore the art of possibility with Generative AI for MAP assessments. Adhere to your organisation's security and compliance policies.
>
> ⚠️ **Session Storage:** All data is stored in browser `sessionStorage`. Data is lost when the browser tab is closed. No server-side persistence is implemented.
>
> ⚠️ **Taiga Credentials:** Taiga API credentials are stored in `backend/utils/taiga_config.json`. For production use, migrate to AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables.

## Best Practices

- Validate all AI-generated recommendations with domain experts
- Test with your specific IT inventory data (application catalogues, server lists)
- Review and customise prompt templates in `prompt_library/` before use
- Monitor Amazon Bedrock usage and costs
- Use sample data in `backend/sample_data/` to familiarise yourself with expected CSV formats
- Store sensitive credentials (Taiga API credentials, AWS keys) in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/) or [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) rather than in configuration files
- Review Amazon Bedrock IAM policies to ensure `bedrock:InvokeModel` permissions are scoped appropriately for your deployment — refer to the [Amazon Bedrock security documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/security-iam.html)
- For SSE-based agent streaming, review Application Load Balancer idle timeout settings to accommodate long-running agent graph executions — the FastAPI + EKS + CloudFront architecture supports this pattern well
- Optionally, use the following guidance to containerise the application using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS):
  - Build Docker images for the FastAPI backend and the React frontend (static build via `npm run build` served by Nginx or similar)
  - Push Docker images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)
  - Define Kubernetes deployment and service manifests for both backend and frontend containers
  - Set up an Amazon EKS cluster with Fargate profile
  - Configure Amazon CloudFront and Application Load Balancer for frontend distribution and API routing
  - Set up an AWS CodePipeline with AWS CodeBuild to automate the build, push to ECR, and Kubernetes manifest deployment
  - Set up Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) with enhanced security features — configure subnets, route tables, and security groups. Implement IAM roles using the principle of least privilege, encryption, network policies, and VPC flow logs. Use Amazon CloudWatch for comprehensive logging, metrics, alarms, and dashboards

## Cost Considerations

- **Amazon Bedrock:** Claude Sonnet 4 usage is billed per input/output token — monitor via Amazon CloudWatch
- **Multi-Agent Graphs:** Discovery, landing zone, and cost agents run multiple LLM calls per request
- **Session-Based:** No external database or vector store costs — all state is in browser session storage
- **Taiga:** Self-hosted or cloud instance costs apply if using project management integration
- Implement caching for repeated analyses to reduce token consumption
